This helps to make our image files accessible over the web through your FastAPI app.
app.mount(...) tells FastAPI that make static folders from a certain folder to be accessible 
at a specific URL path. 
/uploads: serves as a URL prefix
StaticFiles(directory="server/app/images"): tells FastAPI where on your server the actual files are stored. 
name = "uploads": This gives a name to this mounted static route. You donâ€™t really use this unless you're doing 
reverse routing or want to reference this route elsewhere in FastAPI.

So, now : 
http://localhost:8000/uploads/avatars/avatar_123.png -> server/app/images/avatars/avatar_123.png
